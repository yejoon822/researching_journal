Medical robotics: advanced applications, technologies, and future trends.

As a junior who is about to enter college, I am considering to study mechanical engineering, bio engineering, or computer science. I heard about Elon Musk's Neuralink, and was passionately researching about it. 
As I was researching about those field, I learned that there is one special field that requires knowledge and understanding of all three studies.

Combining robots, computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and precision engineering, medical robotics is a quickly expanding field that is revolutionizing healthcare.
These robots reduce human error and improve treatment outcomes by improving surgical precision, recovery, diagnostics, and patient care. 
Robotic medicine will become more autonomous, individualized, and accessible with the use of AI, 5G, and nano-robotics.

Key Categories of Medical Robotics:

Surgical Robotics

Surgical robots assist or perform minimally invasive surgeries, increasing precision, dexterity, and control beyond human capability.

1) Robot-Assisted Surgery (RAS)
Uses robotic arms controlled by surgeons to perform delicate operations with minimal incisions.
Provides greater accuracy, reduced blood loss, shorter recovery times, and fewer complications.
Example: da Vinci Surgical System

Developed by Intuitive Surgical, widely used in urology, gynecology, and cardiac surgeries.
Features:
Master-Slave Teleoperation: Surgeons control robotic arms remotely.
4-Arm System: Includes a camera, surgical instruments, and two manipulator arms.
3D HD Vision & Tremor Filtration: Provides superior visualization and stability.
Other Surgical Robots

MAKO SmartRobotics (Stryker): Used for orthopedic surgeries like knee and hip replacements.
CORI Surgical System (Smith+Nephew): AI-assisted joint replacement.
Hugo RAS (Medtronic): A competitor to da Vinci, focusing on laparoscopic surgeries.
2) Autonomous Surgical Robots
AI-powered robots that perform specific procedures with minimal human intervention.
Examples:
STAR (Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot) – Developed by Johns Hopkins, performs soft tissue suturing autonomously with higher accuracy than human surgeons.
Hansen Medical’s Magellan – Used in cardiovascular procedures.

Rehabilitation Robotics:

These robots assist patients in regaining mobility and strength after injuries or surgeries.

1) Exoskeletons
Wearable robotic devices that aid movement for paralyzed or stroke patients.
Examples:
Ekso Bionics – Helps spinal cord injury patients walk again.
ReWalk Robotics – FDA-approved for home and clinical use.
2) Neurorehabilitation Robots
AI-driven devices that stimulate neural plasticity, helping stroke victims recover motor functions.
Examples:
Armeo Spring (Hocoma) – Assists upper-limb rehabilitation.
InMotion ARM (BIONIK Labs) – Helps patients with impaired arm movement.

Diagnostic & Imaging Robotics:

There was a very interesting topic about this I watched in Youtube, that an AI-powered device found inflammation embedded in the gums that the dentist with 20 years of experience could not find.
So I researched about this topic further, and realized there are various AI-powered machines utilized in various field of medical treatments. 

1) AI-Powered Imaging Assistants
Use machine learning and computer vision to detect abnormalities.
Examples:
ZAP-X Gyroscopic Radiosurgery – AI-driven brain tumor treatment.
Medtronic GI Genius – AI-powered endoscopy system for colorectal cancer detection.
2) Robotic Biopsy Systems
Enable precise tissue sampling with minimal invasiveness.
Example:
Monarch Platform (Auris Health) – AI-powered lung cancer biopsy system.
D. Hospital & Patient Care Robots - I have actually experienced this, as my grandmother was once sick with knee issues. Since I live in Korea, one of the countries that have the most developed medical technology, 


1) Robotic Nurses
Assist in patient monitoring, drug delivery, and elderly care.
Examples:
Moxi (Diligent Robotics) – Autonomous hospital assistant that delivers supplies.
Robear – Japan’s nursing-care robot that lifts patients.
2) Disinfection Robots
Use UV-C light or hydrogen peroxide mist to sterilize hospital environments.
Examples:
Xenex LightStrike – UV disinfection robot used in hospitals.
TMiRob – AI-powered disinfection system in China.
3) AI Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
Provide mental health support, patient education, and symptom assessment.
Examples:
Woebot – AI chatbot for mental health therapy.
Babylon Health – AI-powered telemedicine assistant.
E. Prosthetics & Bionics

Advanced robotic limbs enhance mobility and functionality for amputees.

1) AI-Powered Prosthetics
Neural control interfaces allow patients to control robotic limbs with brain signals.
Examples:
Myoelectric Prosthetics – Uses muscle signals (e.g., Ossur’s i-Limb).
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Prosthetics – Connects directly to the nervous system (e.g., DARPA’s LUKE Arm).
2) Sensory Feedback & Touch Simulation
Next-gen prosthetics integrate haptic sensors for real-time touch sensation.
Example:
Michelangelo Hand (Ottobock) – Offers fine motor control and sensory feedback.
2. Cutting-Edge Technologies in Medical Robotics

A. Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning

Deep learning algorithms analyze medical imaging, surgical data, and patient records to enhance decision-making.
AI-powered robots learn from millions of surgeries, improving precision over time.
B. Computer Vision & Augmented Reality (AR)

Robotic surgery platforms use AR for real-time organ visualization.
HoloLens 2 (Microsoft): Assists surgeons by overlaying 3D anatomical models during operations.
C. Tactile Sensors & Haptics

Robots use force sensors to mimic human touch, improving grip and dexterity.
Soft robotic grippers enable delicate tissue handling.
