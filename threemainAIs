Grok: Grok is a generative AI chatbot developed by xAI. It is based on a large language model (LLM) and was developed on Elon Musk's initiative as a direct response to the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which was developed by OpenAI, a company he co-founded.

ChatGPT: ChatGPT is a prototype conversational AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It is built on GPT-3.5, an improved version of the large language model GPT-3, and was fine-tuned using both supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

DeepSeek: The token price was 2 yuan per million output tokens, which is cheaper than competitors. On the leaderboard of the Waterloo University Tiger Lab, DeepSeek-V2 ranked 7th in the LLM rankings. In December 2024, DeepSeek-V3 was released. It has 671 billion parameters, was trained for about 55 days, and cost 5.58 million USD. It was trained using significantly fewer resources compared to other models.
In May 2024, DeepSeek-V2 was released. The Financial Times reported that the token's price was 2 yuan per one million output tokens, making it cheaper than its competitors.

All three—Deepseek, ChatGPT, and Grok—use AI, but they are trained differently and have different functions. Let’s break it down in terms of training, deep learning, and model architecture.

1. Training Process and Data Sources

Deepseek (Search AI & Language Model)
Training Type: Uses information retrieval and large-scale deep learning.
Data Used: Mostly structured documents, databases, and text collections to find specific information.
Training Goal: Instead of generating new text, Deepseek is optimized to search and retrieve the most relevant answer from existing data.
ChatGPT (Conversational AI - OpenAI)
Training Type: Uses deep learning with transformers (GPT model).
Data Used: Trained on huge datasets (internet text, books, articles, and code).
Training Goal: Learns how humans talk and responds in a natural way, but doesn’t "search" for answers like Deepseek. Instead, it generates responses based on learned patterns.
Grok (Conversational AI - xAI, Elon Musk’s company)
Training Type: Also based on deep learning transformers, like ChatGPT.
Data Used: Trained on large text datasets, but may have a different dataset focus.
Training Goal: Like ChatGPT, it is a conversational model. It may have a different personality and tone because of the way it was fine-tuned.


2. Deep Learning and Model Architecture

Deepseek
Uses a combination of deep learning (transformers) and traditional search algorithms.
Instead of predicting the next word (like ChatGPT), Deepseek focuses on retrieving the most accurate answers.
It may use vector databases and embedding models to understand and match text efficiently.
ChatGPT & Grok
Both use transformer-based deep learning models (like GPT architecture).
These models predict the next best word based on the context of the sentence.
Unlike Deepseek, they generate text from scratch, which means they do not "look up" exact answers but create them based on probabilities.

Deepseek vs. ChatGPT/Grok:
Deepseek finds an existing answer and returns it.
ChatGPT and Grok create a response based on probabilities.
